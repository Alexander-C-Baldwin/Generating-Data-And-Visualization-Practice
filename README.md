# Generating-Data-And-Visualization-Practice
Practice using Python to Generate Data and using the generated data with Matplotlib to create data visualizations.

## Random Walk
A 'random walk' is a path that has no clear direction but is determined by a series of random decisions, each left entirely to chance.
I used Python to generate data for a random walk and used Matplotlib to generate a visually appealing representation of that data.

## Rolling Dice
I used Python to and the Python package Plotly to produce interactive visualizations to analyze the results of rolling dice.
